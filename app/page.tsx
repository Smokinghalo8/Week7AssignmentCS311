Dear Professor, can you please answer these questions, I am very confused about react.js and am only getting more confused about it.


Whats the difference between page.tsx and layout.tsx?
Why does every guide online that I read tell me that I either need to create a new 'pages' folder or a 'components' folder?
Why do I get a different react.js project structure everytime I make a new website?
What's the point of the Public folder?
How are we supposed to navigate between different directories and start a different page?
Why is it every other guide I find online on how to use React, wants me to create 5 different folders before even going into *why* we made them?
How exactly does all of this work together?'<- Actually, like I wanna know which file 'starts' the program when typing npm run dev
Is globals.css just a global css file for the entire website?
Does every tsx file need a return statement?
How is a tsx file layed out, actually? Is there only one tsx file per project? Do we run different subsites as a tsx file or is it just a database?
How can we manipulate objects inside the document??

Is this supposed to be the index base file or is it supposed to be layout.tsx?? Are these supposed to be in the subfolder 'pages'?
What am I supposed to put on here if

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-rows-[20px_1fr_20px] items-center justify-items-center min-h-screen p-8 pb-20 gap-16 sm:p-20 font-[family-name:var(--font-geist-sans)]">
      <main className="flex flex-col gap-8 row-start-2 items-center sm:items-start">

      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
